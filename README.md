**BANK LOAN PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS**
This project shown to customers lending loan dataset to uncover the relationship between borrower behaviour (such as employment length, income, and debt-to-income ratio) and loan characteristics (including amount, term, and interest rate) to unearth critical insights into loan performance metrics. By examining patterns in loan statuses such as fully paid, charged off, or late payments, this analysis aims to empower banking institutions with actionable insights to optimize loan lending strategies, I have attached the workfile below for your reference.
